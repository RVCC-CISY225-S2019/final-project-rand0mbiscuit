# Final Project
## The last project for my class of Web Design

This project is one that has taken a while to create and has helped me learn a lot about HTML and CSS. This project contains information about me, Michael Rivera, a few pictures I have taken myself, a Bunch of Gibberish, a tutorial on how background images in CSS work, as well as a way for you to contact me.
